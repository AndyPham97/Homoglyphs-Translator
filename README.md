A program that translates "homoglyphs" to an actual word.

Note: The DAT file was the assigned glyphs I was given to only be able to translate it to only one word. Therefore, it does not translate to other requested words. Although, if you wish to contribute and make it so that it can translate it to other existing words then that's fine! You can also choose to expand on the sequence of glyphs to your full disposal to enhance the amount of words you can translate it to.
